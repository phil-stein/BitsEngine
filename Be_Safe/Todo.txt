Todo:
	
	- make/find texture for hero_defense_char (color palette texture used in "Hero Defense")
	
	- [x] make a map and player tiles based on that not just a square
	- [x] make the player be abled to walk the new map
	- [x] check the player leaving out the left/right side of the map
	- make it be abled to move between sections
	- make it load based on an image specifying the tiles
	- make the collision-system determine collision based on the image with the tile-layout
	- [x] make the EnvGen. be abled to have multiple strings/imgs as layers for the map, i.e. grass -> wall

	- make the textured materials have tint-colors for the albedo and specular maps

	- make the blank textures, primitives and shaders part of the BitsCore projects asset folder and copy them

	- [prob. obsolete] movement "wraps" when moving out of bound to the left or right

	- add structures/constructs/groups/etc. just a couple of GO's grouped together (prefabs)

	- AssetManager error message when wrong asset-name

Buggs:

	- [x] floor is lit differently than the other objects
	- rotate char in direction of key-press even if that move if blocked
