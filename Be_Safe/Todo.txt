Todo:
	
	Game:
	- make/find texture for hero_defense_char (color palette texture used in "Hero Defense")
	
	- [x] make a map and player tiles based on that not just a square
	- [x] make the player be abled to walk the new map
	- [x] check the player leaving out the left/right side of the map
	- make it be abled to move between sections
	- make it load based on an image specifying the tiles
	- make the collision-system determine collision based on the image with the tile-layout
	- [x] make the EnvGen. be abled to have multiple strings/imgs as layers for the map, i.e. grass -> wall -> vines

	- [x] make pushables
	- [x] @REFACTOR: make a base-class for player and pushables / all other dynamic map-entities
	- move pushable logic from EnvController to TileObject
	- make the tile-check based on the type of object, i.e. so that pushable objects can be pushed into the water
	- make a button / pressure-plate you can push objects onto 

	- [x] add seperate text for current-tile [x] / player-pos[x] / draw-calls [x]

	GameDesign:
	- find a name
	- make basic design concept
	- design level using the push mechanics

	Engine:
	- make the textured materials have tint-colors for the albedo and specular maps
	- make the blank textures, primitives and shaders part of the BitsCore projects asset folder and copy them
	- add a tween-utils class that can move/rotate/scale objects smoothly over time
	- add structures/constructs/groups/etc. just a couple of GO's grouped together (prefabs)
	- add simple particle-system
	- add simple batch-rendering


Buggs:

	- [x] floor is lit differently than the other objects
	- [x] movement "wraps" when moving out of bound to the left or right
	- rotate char in direction of key-press even if that move if blocked
	- AssetManager error message when wrong asset-name
	- moving into pushable object on the left & right
