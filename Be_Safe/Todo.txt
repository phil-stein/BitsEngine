Todo:
	
	- make/find texture for hero_defense_char
	
	- make a map and playe tiles based on that not just a square
	- make it load based on an image specifying the tiles
	- make the player be abled to walk the new map
	- make the collision-system determine collision based on the image with the tile-layout
	- make it be abled to move between sections

	- rotate char in direction of key-press even if that move if blocked

	- make the textured materials have tint-colors for the albedo and specular maps

	- make the blank textures, primitives and shaders part of the BitsCore projects asset folder and copy them

	- [prob. obsolete] movement "wraps" when moving out of bound to the left or right

	- add structures/constructs/groups/etc. just a couple of GO's grouped together (prefabs)
